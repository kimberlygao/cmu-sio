                <h2>Course Information</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Specs</h3>
                <p>Units: 15 (FCE: 10.4)</p>
                <p>Deparment: Human-Computer Interaction</p>
                <p>Course Level: Undergraduate</p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>This course is combines lecture, and an intensive programming lab and design studio. It is for those who want to express their interactive ideas in working prototypes. It will cover the importance of human-computer interaction/interface design, iterative design, input/output techniques, how to design and evaluate interfaces, and research topics that will impact user interfaces in the future. In lab, you will learn how to design and program effective graphical user interfaces, and how to perform user tests. We will cover a number of prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews of student work. This course is for HCII Masters students and HCI dual majors with a minimal programming background. Students will often not be professional programmers, but will need to interact with programmers. <br>RECITATION SELECTION: Students taking this course can sign up for either Prototyping Lab recitation.</p>
                <h3>Prequesites</h3>
                <p>Completion of one of the following courses: 15-100 15-127 or 15-104 or 15-110 or 15-112</p>
                <p>Knowledge: Proficiency in a programming language, program structure, algorithm analysis, and data abstraction. Normally met through an introductory programming course using C, C++, Pascal or Java, such as 15100, 15112, 15127 or equivalent. Students entering this course should be able to independently write a 300-line program in 48 hours.</p>
                <h3>Course Profile</h3>
                <p><u>Key Topics:</u> The course will cover the basics of rapid prototyping, discount usability, user testing, perception and cognition as related to UX design, and get a glimpse of the future of UX design</p>
                <p><u>Course Relevance:</u> Students taking this course will have a stronger grasp of concepts fundamental to UX design, including rapid prototyping, discount usability, perception and cognition, and more.</p>
                <p><u>Course Goals:</u> Students will have a deeper conceptual and procedural knowledge as to how to design, implement, and evaluate user interfaces.</p>
                <p><u>Assessment Structure:</u> There will be a midterm, final, in-class quizzes, labs, and several homework assignments.</p>
                <p><u>Learning Resources:</u> Students will be required to read The Design of Everyday Things by Donald Norman. There will also be many web resources on rapid prototyping.</p>
                <p><u>Extra Time Commitment:</u> Students will be expected to meet with other students as part of some of the homework assignments.</p>
