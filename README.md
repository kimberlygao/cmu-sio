A redesign of CMU SIO with limited functionality of adding and removing courses for now. Data is stored with session storage and disappears after the browser is closed.

Bonus Features
- Page is mainly responsive to sizing using mainly percentage grid sizes and divs to separate information
- One interesting thing I implemented was alerting the user when they tried to add a course already in the cart and preventing the action such that no errors occur.
- Feedback and details page work for both courses in the catalog and are not hard coded in.
